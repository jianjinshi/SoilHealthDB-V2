# SoilHealthDB-V2
A database for global soil health assessment, version 2.

## About
SoilHealthDB-V2 is an updated and standardized database of soil health under conservation management. It compiles 8,874 data entries from 453 published studies, covering 73 background indicators and 48 soil health indicators. This database provides a unified framework for sharing soil health information, and we encouraged the scientific community to contribute their own measurements to further expand and improve this resource.

## Major updates
*	Background indicators: An experiment ID comments column was added to record distinguishing details about control and treatment pairs. Duration--related indicators (e.g., start year and end year of the experiment), soil background information (e.g., soil nitrogen, phosphorus content), and cover crop management indicators such as plating and termination dates, termination methods, and applied irrigation and fertilization for cover crops were included.
*	Soil health indicators: Soil carbon pool related indicators (fast, slow and passive carbon), water use amount, water use efficiency, and microbial biomass phosphorus were added.
*	Standardization: All soil health indicators were standardized by adding 6 new columns: index value of control, index value of treatment, standard deviation of control, standard deviation of treatment, unit of the index and comments on the index (including index name, unit information, and data source).
*	Data sources: The original research papers were compiled from studies cited in meta-analyses and review papers conducted by Garba et al. (2022), Lu (2020), Mbava et al. (2020), Wang et al. (2021), and Yu et al. (2021).

## How to contribute
We welcome contributions to improve this database:
*	For listed papers: Add missing or correct existing data entries.
*	For new studies: Add new rows following the same data framework.
*	For all updates: Submit a pull request or open an issue on GitHub, or contact us by email (see below).
